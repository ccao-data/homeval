# We don't have a way of setting this `environment` attribute in the
# report generation script, which is how we set it for the reports. That
# means we can't dynamically adjust this attribute depending on the deploy
# environment. While in the future we might want to implement the ability to
# do that, for now the only consequence of this attribute being hardcoded to
# prod is that the link ref for the "back to search" button always points to
# the prod web form. That's not a huge deal, so for the sake of simplicity, we
# use a hardcoded `environment` for now
environment: prod
